- This project is developed to predict the normal or violent behaviours on real time videos. The project has gone through various stages, including analyzing behaviors, making predictions with various models, and evaluating the performance of the model.

By understanding various  behaviors, polices,securtiy guards can make informed decisions  and address any areas that may lead to violent behaviours.

## Project Objectives

The main objectives of the project are as follows:
- Plotting skeleton to collect datas from behaviors.
- Develop various models to classified behaviours.
- Use different methods to select the best model and optimize it.
- Monitor and evaluate the model's performance.

## Overview

The main objectives of this project are as follows:

- **Analyze and Visualize annotated videos:**
  - Utilized exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to gain insights into normal and violent videos.
  - Visualized key metrics using Matplotlib and other data visualization tools.

- **Model Optimization:**
  - Employed different methods to select the best-performing model.
  - Utilized hyperparameter tuning and keras tuner optimize model performance.

## Models
 - Classification model(Lstm)
 - Pose Estimation yolov7
